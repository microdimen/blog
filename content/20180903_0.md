## Abstract

Bitcoin is programmable based on Transaction Script. However, it’s not turing complete and there exists no global state shared between transactions. Ethereum is commended as the decentralized-super computer in the world. It deserves the praise since it has the ability to handle almost all tasks, like token transfers and complex cryptographic calculations (if you have enough gas of course). EVM is the underlying operating system to drive smart contracts. In this post, I will explain what EVM is and how it actually works. For more details on implementation, please refer to the project [evmplay](https://github.com/microdimen/evmplay)

## Transaction

Everything happens because of transaction. There are roughly three kinds of transactions: Contract Creation, Contract Call, and ETH Transfer, and a typical transaction has the following attributes.

```rust 
pub struct Transaction {
    pub nonce: U256,
    pub gas_price: U256,
    pub gas: U256,
    pub action: Action,
    pub value: U256,
    pub data: Bytes,
}
```

The above three kinds of transactions are categorized into two different actions: Create and Call. Action::Create is for contract creation apparently, while Action::Call is a little bit confusing. 

```rust
pub enum Action {
    Create,
    Call(Address),
}
```

We already know that contract’s account and normal user’s account are treated the same in Ethereum. They all have the properties of address and balance. If a transaction of Action::Call with some value is processed, it means that someone wants to transfer ETH to another, no matter whether the receiver is a normal account or a contract. On the other side, if the carried value equals zero, it means calling a function of the contract at the given address.

## EVM

EVM is a stack-based virtual machine executing instructions compiled from contracts written in Solidity. There exist over a hundred of different instructions supported by EVM now. Consider the following contract.

```
contract simple {
    function say_hello()
    public
    pure
    returns (string)
    {
        return "hello world";
    }
}
```

We compile the code by solc or in the remix browser and get a long line of hex numbers.

```
0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50336000806101000a81548173ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff021916908373ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff16021790555060008060146101000a81548163ffffffff021916908363ffffffff1602179055506101b5806100816000396000f300608060405260043610610041576000357c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000090… ffff1663ffffffff16815260200191505060405180910390a2505600a165627a7a723058209e74d819b2f8cb7962772e64024337d1336eb327b718c2c7977595721cf4105d0029
```

What is the above bytecode doing? A direct answer is that it’s responsible for the creation of your contract, and it works like an application installer you are familiar with on your laptop. Let’s translate the binary code into assembly instructions.

```assembly
.code
  PUSH 80            // Push 0x80 and 0x40 into stack                       
  PUSH 40                      
  MSTORE             // MSTORE(0x40, 0x80), reserve 0x80 bytes of memory for internal uses             
  CALLVALUE          // Push the value carried by the transaction into stack      
  DUP1               // Duplicate the top item
  ISZERO             // Check if the CALLVALUE is zero           
  PUSH [tag] 1       // Push the tag of Code Copy into stack           
  JUMPI              // If CALLVALUE is zero, jump to tag 1, or continue           
  PUSH 0                        
  DUP1                  
  REVERT             // Failed to deploy contract, revert and cleanup          
tag 1                   
  JUMPDEST           // The destination of jump         
  POP                  
  PUSH 13f           // Push the length of code to copy          
  DUP1                 
  PUSH 20            // Push the offset
  PUSH 0             // Push the start            
  CODECOPY           // Copy 0x13f length of data from 0x20 to 0x0             
  PUSH 0                        
  RETURN                        
```

It’s quite interesting. Isn’t it? When we compile the contract, the compiler generates the deployment code for free. Now let’s dive into the source code to see how CODECOPY is implemented.

```rust
fn copy_data_to_memory(mem: &mut Vec<u8>, stack: &mut Stack<U256>, source: &[u8]) {
    let dest_offset = stack.pop_back();
    let source_offset = stack.pop_back();
    let size = stack.pop_back();
    let source_size = U256::from(source.len());

    let output_end = match source_offset > source_size || size > source_size || source_offset + size > source_size {
        true => {
            let zero_slice = if source_offset > source_size {
                mem.writeable_slice(dest_offset, size)
            } else {
                mem.writeable_slice(dest_offset + source_size - source_offset, source_offset + size - source_size)
            };
            for i in zero_slice.iter_mut() {
                *i = 0;
            }
            source.len()
        },
        false => (size.low_u64() + source_offset.low_u64()) as usize
    };

    if source_offset < source_size {
        let output_begin = source_offset.low_u64() as usize;
        mem.write_slice(dest_offset, &source[output_begin..output_end]);
    }
}
```

As you see, the implementation is straightforward. There is no mysterious magic inside EVM;)

## Conclusion

We still have a lot to talk about EVM. For example, how the contract is called, how the gas is calculated, and so on. What’s more, I have successfully compiled some contracts into WebAssembly and executed them inside eWASM, which worked like a charm. The main net of Ethereum will be switched to eWASM in near future and are you ready for that?
